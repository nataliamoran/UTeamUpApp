## Page structure

In the following sections, we will be defining and using these terms:

1. The page refers to all the content shown in the browser window/tab.
2. The navigator refers to the horizontal bar located on the top of
   the page, together with all content within it.
3. An action refers to a link or button that leads the visitor to
   somewhere *within* the website.
4. A view refers to everything on the page except the navigator.
   There can be only one view at a time in the page, but the view
   may change when the visitor is clicking on an action. View names
   are represented in **bold font**.

## Navigator

There are three main components in the navigator: the back button,
the app title, and the menu.

The back button allows you to go back to a previous view when you
click on it.

The app title shows the name of this web app, and will lead you to
the default view (**team search**) when you click on it.

The menu, when clicked, will show a list of actions, depending on
whether the visitor is logged in or not, and its identity (admin
or normal user).
